```markdown
# 🧠 Next Word Prediction using LSTM

A deep learning project that predicts the next word in a sentence using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural networks. Built using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and deployed via **Streamlit** for interactive exploration.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the power of Recurrent Neural Networks, specifically **LSTM**, in handling sequential text data. It learns patterns from a dataset (e.g., Shakespeare's *Hamlet*) and predicts the next likely word in a user-provided sentence fragment.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Train an LSTM model on text data
- Predict the next word based on input sentence
- Tokenize and preprocess text
- Streamlit UI for interaction
